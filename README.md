# Feather Image Converter

A PyQt app to make mass-converting images from one file type to another easier.

Inspired by how many services (such as Google Docs) do not support with the .webp image format, which has become fairly common. This becomes cumbersome when trying to import a lot of graphs or images within a project, as each would need to be individually converted. This program seeks to make that process easier with just a few clicks.

## Features

- Live image preview
- Simple to use
- Cross platform
- Choose desired image format (Coming Soon)

## Running the Program

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nickschirloff/feather-image-converter
```

Switch to new directory

```bash
  cd Python-Image-Conveter
```

Create & run venv

```bash
  python -m venv ./venv/
  ./venv/Scripts/activate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Program, or the .exe

```bash
  python feather.py
```


## Roadmap
