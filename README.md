A PyQt app to make mass-converting images from one file type to another.

Inspired by how many services (such as Google Docs) have issues working with the .webp format, which has
become fairly common. When trying to import many graphs and images within a document, individually
converting each file can be cumbersome. This program seeks to make that process easier.

Install dependencies and run main.py

Program is completely functional, but of course needs testing, please report any bugs encountered.

TODO:
- Move output from console to app
- Add more controls and options
- Better UI display
- Code cleanup & optimizations

Plans to be implemented in the future:
- Converting entire directories
    i.e.: Convert all images in all folders in imgs
    /imgs
        /graphs
        /photos
